# ResNetClassifiers.github.io
Hello everyone ,welcome to my Github Repo . 
I followed some very intuitive explanations on Jason Brownlee's website Machine [MachineLearningMastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) .
I tried to take one step further by adding ResNet blocks to the classifiers and also trained some more classifiers for other datasets .
I am providing the code as well as trained weights .All of which are tested on Python 3.7 and Tensorflow 1.15 
Please note a code developed on some version of Tensorflow may run but might give very unexpected behaviour on other versions of Tensorflow
If you are using Colab just use this command before running any cell ** %tensorflow_version 1.x ** and then restart the Runtime .
My Machine for all the implementations is Nvidia DGX-2 Cuda 10.1 ,Tf 1.15 ,Python 3.7
