# ResNet based image classifiers 
Hello everyone ,welcome to my Github Repo . 
While developing my GAN project ,I also had to train some classfiers for the pipeline to do that .
I followed some very intuitive explanations on Jason Brownlee's website [MachineLearningMastery](https://machinelearningmastery.com/) .
I tried to take one step further by adding ResNet blocks to the classifiers and also trained some more classifiers for other datasets .
I am providing the code as well as trained weights .All of which are tested on Python 3.7 and Tensorflow 1.15 
Please note a code developed on some version of Tensorflow may run but might give very unexpected behaviour on other versions of Tensorflow
If you are using Colab just use this command before running any cell **%tensorflow_version 1.x** and then restart the Runtime .
The  Machine for all my implementations is Nvidia GTX 1650 ,AMD Ryzen 7 8GB Ram .Cuda 10.1 .
